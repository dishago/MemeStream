Implementation done using the following-
    -Nodejs
    -Express
    -EJS
    -MongoDB
    -Mongoose

API routes are as follows-
    GET /
    GET /memes
    POST /memes
    GET /memes/:id
    PATCH /memes/:id
    GET /memes/:id/edit

Since EJS is used, there is no separate frontend and backend. The frontend HTML is dynamically rendered using Express and EJS.
